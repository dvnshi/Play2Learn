                In a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and blooming meadows, there lived a curious and adventurous girl named Zara. Zara had a secret hideaway—a magical garden where butterflies danced and flowers whispered tales of safety and joy.<br></p>
                
                One day, as Zara watered her garden, a wise old tortoise named Guruji appeared. With a twinkle in his eyes, Guruji began to share a magical story about a special right—the "Right to a Safe Environment."<br><p>
                
                The story unfolded in a nearby village where a boy named Kabir discovered a mysterious key. This magical key, Guruji explained, symbolized a child's right to a safe and secure environment. Kabir's heart swelled with courage as he realized he held the power to create a haven of safety for every child.</p><br>
                
                Inspired, Zara embarked on a quest to spread the magic of the key in her own village. Along the way, she met her friends Aryan, Meera, and little Arjun. Together, they discovered that each child had their own magical key—the right to live, play, and learn in a safe environment.<p><br>
                
                As the children shared the magic with their elders, the village transformed into a haven of laughter and security. The grown-ups, enlightened by the children's wisdom, worked together to ensure safe parks, clean water, and protected spaces for every child.<br>
                
                Zara's magical garden became a symbol of the village's commitment to the right to a safe environment. Guruji, appearing once more, commended the children for spreading the magic of the key, teaching everyone that safety is not just a wish—it's a right.</p><br>
                
                <p><b>The moral of the story</b><br><br> is that every child possesses a magical key—the "Right to a Safe Environment." By using this key, children can transform their surroundings into havens of joy and security. Just like Zara and her friends, every child has the power to create a world where laughter echoes in safe spaces, and every heart blossoms like a flower in a magical garden.</p>
