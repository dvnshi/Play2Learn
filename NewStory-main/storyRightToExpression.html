<p>In a vibrant town in India, nestled between emerald-green hills, lived a spirited boy named Aarav. Aarav had a heart as colorful as the marketplaces of his town, and he loved expressing himself through his imaginative drawings.</p><br>

One day, as Aarav doodled happily near the old banyan tree, he met a friendly parrot named Gulabi. Intrigued by Aarav's art, Gulabi decided to share a magical tale about a special right - the "Right to Express."<br><p>

Gulabi told Aarav about a young artist named Kavi in a nearby village. Kavi, just like Aarav, loved expressing himself through poetry. But one day, Kavi felt his creative spirit being silenced.</p><br>

Kavi discovered his magical brush, symbolizing the "Right to Expression." This brush allowed him to paint his thoughts freely. Inspired, Aarav felt a warmth in his heart, realizing he too possessed a magical tool - his "Right to Express."<br>

Excited, Aarav rushed to share this magical secret with his friends - Meera, Raj, and little Anaya. They decided to organize a grand Art Mela where every child could showcase their unique talents.
<p>
As the Art Mela unfolded, the town square turned into a canvas of joy. Children danced, sang, painted, and recited poems. Aarav, with his magical brush, felt the freedom to express himself without any fear.<br>

Just then, the wise old storyteller, Dadiji, joined the celebration. She explained to the children that their right to express was like a treasure, and with it, they could paint the world with kindness and creativity.</p><br>

<p><b>The moral of the story </b><br>is that every child, just like Aarav and his friends, has a magical tool - the "Right to Express." Whether through art, words, or actions, every child can contribute to making the world more colorful and beautiful. So, children, embrace your magical right, express yourselves freely, and let your creativity soar like a kite in the Indian sky!
