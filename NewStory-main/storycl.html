               <p> Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a young boy named Raj. He had big dreams of going to school, playing with friends, and becoming someone important in life. However, his dreams were shattered when he was forced to work in a factory instead of holding a book.</p><br>

                One day, Raj met a wise old man who told him about his right to education and the protection against child labor. The old man shared stories of brave children who stood up for their rights and changed their destinies.<br><p>
                
                Inspired by these tales, Raj decided to take a stand. With the support of friends and community members, he organized a peaceful protest against child labor. His efforts caught the attention of authorities, and soon, the factory was shut down.</p><br>
                
                Raj's story became an inspiration for other children in the village, and they realized the importance of education and their right to live a childhood full of dreams. Together, they transformed their village into a place where every child could go to school and play freely, breaking the chains of child labor.
                
                The story of Raj teaches us that every child has the right to dream, learn, and grow without the burden of child labor.
