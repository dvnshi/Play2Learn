               <p> 
               
               

                Once upon a time in a Piprai village, there lived a young girl named Seema. Seema was known for her bright smile and endless curiosity. One sunny day, while exploring the village outskirts, she stumbled upon a hidden garden, her secret sanctuary.<br>
                
                In this magical garden, flowers whispered tales of courage and resilience. One day, a wise old butterfly named Flutterby noticed Seema's concerns about a friend who seemed sad. Flutterby decided to share a special story with Seema to help her understand an important secret about protection.</p><p>
                
                The story began with a brave child named Aarav, who, like Seema, had a secret garden. In Aarav's garden, everyone felt safe and loved. But one day, a shadowy figure tried to harm Aarav in a way that made him feel uncomfortable.<br>
                
                That's when Aarav discovered his magical shield—the "Right to Protection from Sexual Offences." This shield, given to every child, protected them from harm and ensured they could enjoy their secret gardens without fear.</p>
                
                Aarav, with the help of his shield, spoke up about the wrongdoing. The wise owl of the garden, Ollie, explained that it's important for children to understand that they have the right to say "no" and the right to be protected from any harm that makes them uncomfortable.<br><p>
                
                Seema listened attentively, realizing that her magical shield was just as powerful. Flutterby reminded her that she, too, had the right to protection. Excited, Seema promised to share this secret with her friends.
            </p>
                The next day, Seema gathered her friends under the old oak tree and shared the magical secret of the "Right to Protection from Sexual Offences." Each child felt a surge of strength as they embraced their shields, knowing they were safe and protected.<br>
                
               <b> The moral of the story </b>is that every child possesses a magical shield—the right to protection from harm. Just like Aarav, Seema, and their friends, every child has the power to speak up, stay safe, and protect their secret gardens. By understanding and using this magical shield, children can create a world where they feel loved, secure, and free to explore their dreams.
