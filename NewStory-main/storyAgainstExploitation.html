                Once upon a time, in a small village named Ranjhi, there lived a curious and spirited boy named Aaditya. Aaditya loved exploring the world around him, but one day he stumbled upon something that made him frown - a group of children working tirelessly in a factory. Determined to make a change, Aaditya embarked on a magical adventure that would teach him and his friends about their legal rights against exploitation.</p><p>
                
                As Aaditya wandered through the village, he met a wise old man named Grandpa Sage who sensed Aaditya's concern. Grandpa Sage gifted Aaditya a magical shield and said, "Aaditya, this shield represents your rights. Use it wisely, and remember, every child has the right to be protected from exploitation.</p><br>
                
                With the magical shield in hand, Aaditya gathered his friends - Riya, Aryan, and Aniket. Together, they decided to confront the factory owner, a grumpy old man named Mr. Greedmore. Armed with the shield and a determination to make things right, they approached him.<br><p>
                
                To their surprise, the shield began to glow as they spoke about the rights against exploitation. It created a force field of protection around them, empowering the children to speak up and demand their rights. Mr. Greedmore, realizing he couldn't exploit the children any longer, agreed to follow the laws and provide them with proper education and care.</p><br>
                
                As the magical shield worked its wonders, Aaditya and his friends learned an important lesson: every child has the right to be free from exploitation. They decided to spread awareness about their magical shield and rights to all the children in Ranjhi.
                
              <p> <b>The moral of the story</b> is that every child possesses a magical shield of rights that protects them from exploitation. By knowing and using their rights, children can create a world where they are safe, happy, and free to explore their dreams. So, children, remember your magical shield of rights, and let it guide you to a future filled with fairness and joy!</p>
