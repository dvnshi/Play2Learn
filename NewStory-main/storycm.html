            <div id="content">
               <p> Once upon a time, in a small village named Balanganj, lived a bright and curious girl named Ananya. Ananya loved going to school, playing with her friends, and dreaming of a future filled with possibilities. Little did she know that her life was about to take an unexpected turn.</p>

               <p> One sunny day, as Ananya was playing near the village square, she overheard the elders discussing something in hushed tones. Curiosity getting the better of her, she approached her grandmother, Dadi, to inquire.
                
                "Dadi, what are they talking about?" Ananya asked, her eyes wide with curiosity.</p><p>
                
                Dadi took Ananya's hands in hers and sat her down. She began to tell Ananya a story—a story that would teach her about an important right she held as a child.<br>
                
                "Ananya, my dear," Dadi began, "there was a time when children like you were not protected from something called child marriage. Child marriage meant that boys and girls as young as you were forced to marry before they were ready."
                
                Ananya frowned, not understanding why anyone would want that.</p><br><p>
                
                Dadi continued, "But then, the wise leaders of our country realized that it was not right. Every child, like every flower, needs time to blossom. They decided that children should have the right to choose when and whom to marry."
                
                Ananya's eyes widened with realization. "So, I have the right to decide when I want to get married?" she asked.</p><br>
                
                Dadi nodded, "Yes, Ananya. You have the right to live your childhood, go to school, and dream big dreams. The law protects you from being married off before you're ready."<br><p>
                
                Ananya felt a sense of relief and gratitude. She understood that her right against child marriage was like a shield, keeping her safe until she was old enough to make important decisions about her life.</p><br>
                
                From that day forward, Ananya became an advocate for children's rights in her village. She shared her knowledge with friends and neighbors, ensuring that every child knew about their right against child marriage.<br>
                
                And so, the village of Balanganj became a place where children could grow, learn, and dream freely—thanks to the understanding of their rights and the protection offered by the laws of the land.
