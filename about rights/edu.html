        <h3 class="heading" id="h3_1">Right to Education Act</h3>
        <p class="subHeading" id="sh1">The Act is completely titled “the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act”. It was passed by the Parliament in August 2009. When the Act came into force in 2010, India became one among 135 countries where education is a fundamental right of every child.</p><br>
        <ul class="list" id="l1">
            <li>
                The 86th Constitutional Amendment (2002) inserted Article 21A in the <a href="https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/constitution-of-india-an-overview/">Indian Constitution</a> which states:
                <i>“The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of 6 to 14 years in such manner as the State, may by law determine.”</i>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                As per this, the right to education was made a <a href="https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/fundamental-rights/">fundamental right</a> and removed from the list of Directive Principles of State Policy.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The RTE is the consequential legislation envisaged under the 86th Amendment.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The article incorporates the word “free” in its title. What it means is that no child (other than those admitted by his/her parents in a school not supported by the government) is liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.
            </li><br>
            <li>This Act makes it obligatory on the part of the government to ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children falling in the age bracket six to fourteen years.
            </li><br>
            <li> Essentially, this Act ensures free elementary education to all children in the economically weaker sections of society<span id="dots">...</span></li><br>

            <h3 class="heading" id="h3_2">RTE Provisions</h3>
            <p class="subHeading" id="sh2">The provisions of the RTE Act are briefly described below. The Act provides for:</p></br>
            <ul class="list" id="l2">
                <li>The right of free and compulsory education to children until they complete their elementary education in a school in the neighbourhood.</li><br>
                <li>The Act makes it clear that ‘compulsory education’ implies that it is an obligation on the part of the government to ensure the admission, attendance and completion of elementary education of children between the ages of six and fourteen. The word ‘free’ indicates that no charge is payable by the child which may prevent him/her from completing such education.</li><br>
                <li>The Act provides for the admission of a non-admitted child to a class of his/her appropriate age.</li><br>
                <li>It mentions the duties of the respective governments, the local authorities and parents in ensuring the education of a child. It also specifies the sharing of the financial burden between the central and the state governments.</li><br>
                <li>It specifies standards and norms for Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTR), infrastructure and buildings, working days of the school and for the teachers.</li><br>
                <li>It also says there should be no urban-rural imbalance in teacher postings. The Act also provides for the prohibition of the employment of teachers for non-educational work, other than census, elections and disaster relief work.
                </li><br>
                <li>The Act provides that the teachers appointed should be appropriately trained and qualified.</li><br>
                <li>The Act prohibits:<ul class="subList" id="l2.1">
                    <li>Mental harassment and physical punishment.</li><br>
                    <li>Screening procedures for the admission of children.</li><br>
                    <li>Capitation fees.</li><br>
                    <li>Private tuition by the teachers.</li><br>
                    <li>Running schools with no recognition.</li>
                </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>The Act envisages that the curriculum should be developed in coherence with the values enshrined in the Indian Constitution, and that which would take care of the all-round development of the child. The curriculum should build on the knowledge of the child, on his/her potentiality and talents, help make the child free of trauma, fear and anxiety via a system that is both child-centric and child-friendly.</li><br>
            </ul>      
            <!-- heading 3 -->
            <h3 class="heading" id="h3_3">Significance of RTE</h3>
            <p class="subHeading" id="sh3">With the passing of the Right to Education Act, India has moved to a rights-based approach towards implementing education for all. This Act casts a legal obligation on the state and central governments to execute the fundamental rights of a child (as per Article 21 A of the Constitution).</p>
            <ul class="list" id="l3">
                <li>The Act lays down specific standards for the student-teacher ratio, which is a very important concept in providing quality education.</li><br>
                <li>It also talks about providing separate toilet facilities for girls and boys, having adequate standards for classroom conditions, drinking water facilities, etc.</li><br>
                <li>The stress on avoiding the urban-rural imbalance in teachers’ posting is important as there is a big gap in the quality and numbers regarding education in the villages compared to the urban areas in the country.</li><br>
                <li>The Act provides for zero tolerance against the harassment and discrimination of children. The prohibition of screening procedures for admission ensures that there would be no discrimination of children on the basis of caste, religion, gender, etc.</li><br>
                <li><b>The Act also mandates that no kid is detained until class 8.</b> It introduced the Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) system in 2009 to have grade-appropriate learning outcomes in schools.</li><br>
                <li>The Act also provides for the formation of a School Management Committee (SMC) in every school in order to promote participatory democracy and governance in all elementary schools. These committees have the authority to monitor the school’s functioning and prepare developmental plans for it.</li><br>
                <li>The Act is justiciable and has a Grievance Redressal mechanism that permits people to take action when the provisions of the Act are not complied with.</li><br>
                <li><b>The RTE Act mandates for all private schools to reserve 25 per cent of their seats for children from socially disadvantaged and economically backward sections.</b> This move is intended to boost social inclusion and pave the way for a more just and equal country.
                  <ul class="subList" id="l3.1">
                    <li>This provision is included in Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act. All schools (private, unaided, aided or special category) must reserve 25% of their seats at the entry-level for students from the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and disadvantaged groups.</li><br>
                    <li>When the rough version of the Act was drafted in 2005, there was a lot of outcry in the country against this large percentage of seats being reserved for the underprivileged. However, the framers of the draft stood their ground and were able to justify the 25% reservation in private schools.</li><br>
                    <li>This provision is a far-reaching move and perhaps the most important step in so far as <b>inclusive education</b> is concerned.</li><br>
                    <li>This provision seeks to achieve social integration.</li><br>
                    <li>The loss incurred by the schools as a result of this would be reimbursed by the central government.</li><br>
                  </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>The Act has increased enrolment in the upper primary level (Class 6-8) between 2009 and 2016 by 19.4%.</li><br>
                <li>In rural areas, in 2016, only 3.3% of children in the 6 – 14 years bracket were out of school.</li><br>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="heading" id="h3_4">Explanation:</h3>
        <p>
            Sure! Imagine you have a superpower called the "Right to Education." This superpower is like a magical shield that protects every child in India and gives them the chance to go to school and learn cool stuff.
            In simple words, the "Right to Education" in India means that every child has the special right to go to school and get an education. It doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl, where you live, or how much money your family has – this superpower makes sure that every child gets a fair chance to learn and grow.
            Just like superheroes have rules to follow, the "Right to Education" has a few rules too. One important rule is that schools can't say "no" to any child who wants to learn. They have to open their doors to everyone. Also, the government helps make sure that schools are good places for learning and that teachers are doing a great job.
            So, because of the "Right to Education" superpower, every child in India can dream big, study hard, and become whatever they want – maybe even a superhero themselves! It's like a fantastic adventure where every child gets to be the hero of their own story.
