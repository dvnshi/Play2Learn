            Once upon a time,in a very small village nestled amidst rolling hills,
            there lived a young girl named Lila. She had dreams and an curiosity.
            But there was one obstacle standing in her way: she had never been tor
            school.Lila’s parents were poor farmers, struggling to make ends meet.
            They believed that education was a luxury reserved for the privileged.
            So, Lila spent her days tending to the goats, fetching water from the
            well, and helping her mother with household chores. But her heart is 
            for something more—a chance to learn,to explore,and to grow.One sunny
            morning,as Lila sat under the ancient banyan tree,she noticed a group
            of children walking past.They wore crisp uniforms , carried colorful
            backpacks.Their laughter echoed through the air, their eyes sparkled
            with knowledge.Lila watch them with mixture of awe and envy.Determine
            to change  fate,Lila approached  village elder,Grandma Kamala.Grandma
            Kamala is wise woman,known for her kindness and compassion Lila poured
            out her heart, she is expressing her desire to attend the school.
