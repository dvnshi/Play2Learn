            Gloria’s parents spent their days by the river, hoping for a lucky catch
            to sell fish and feed their family. But luck was scarce, and Gloria and 
            her siblings often went to the bed hungry. When her father passed away, 
            Gloria’s mother faced an impossible burden:providing for 10 young child.
            At just 12 years old, Gloria found herself married to a 35-year-old man.
            Poverty forced her into this union, and fear filled her heart She didn’t
            understand  meaning of marriage, but she knew that refusing would leave
            her with nowhere else to go. Instead of the significant dowry her family 
            hoped for, Gloria’s new husband gave them a single goat.As a child bride,
            Gloria lost her freedom.She stopped going school,tending to her husband’s
            needs instead.The terror of an unwanted physical relationship haunted her.
            After six months, she discovered she was pregnant,feeling pain beyond her 
            years.“When I was staying with Mum, I was free,” Gloria reminisced. “Now,
            in the house I was taken to, I wasn’t free. He decided everything.” Her 
            dreams of education vanished, replaced by the harsh reality of marriage.
            Gloria’s story is one of resilience and sacrifice, echoing the plight of
            millions of girls worldwide are suffering , from this from her childhood.
