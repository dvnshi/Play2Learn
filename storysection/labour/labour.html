            In a small village named Nigmakar, there lived a little boy named Ram.
            His family consisted of four members:Ram, his parents,and his younger
            sister. Unfortunately,due to health issues,Ram’s father couldn’t work,
            and  mother resorted to begging on the streets to feed the family.Ram,
            determined to make a difference , worked tirelessly at a nearby Dhaba 
           (roadside eatery) to provide for his family.His little sister longed to
            study,but they lacked the means to send her to school.Despite the hard,
            Ram never lost hope.One day, while walking to work, Ram encountered an 
            old man who was weak and coughing. Ram helped him , and in return, the 
            old man revealed himself as a divine being . He promised Ram a wish if 
            he passed other tests of kindness. Ram’s first test came when he met a 
            sad little girl who couldn’t afford chocolates. On his salary day, Ram
            bought chocolates for her,and the old man appeared again,congratulatin
            him . The next test involved a starving child lying on the street .Ram, 
            torn between paying the electricity bill and feeding the child , chose 
            kindness. He fed the child with his own hands .The old man reappeared, 
            blessed Ram , and granted him a wish. Ram wished that no child would 
            have to do  work very hard  and that they could all study in schools .
